# dynamic_data_structures

The purpose of this project is to create a base of minerals. Minerals are grouped in catalogs assigned to the countries in which they occur. Records are described by the name of the mineral, composition and unique number.

The program allows you to:
- add a new catalog;
- change a name of existing catalog;
- delete a catalog;
- display a list of catalogs;
- add a new record;
- change a record's data;
- move a record;
- display data;
- load data from file.
